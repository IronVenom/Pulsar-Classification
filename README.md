# Pulsar-Classification
Implemented various classification models (KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest) for pulsar classification. Built an ensemble classifier using the stack generalization method with former five models as the base models and a Logistic Regression Classifier as the metal model, and achieved an overall accuracy of 98.25%.
